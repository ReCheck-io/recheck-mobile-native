            2.2. Personal data collected upon the use of our blockchain-based
            services
          </p>
          <p>
            The ReCheck mobile application is the tool that creates, stores,
            manages and restores the unique anonymous identity of the smartphone
            user and thus the mobile application is a mandatory component of the
            use of any of our blockchain-based services.
          </p>
          <p>
            When installing the ReCheck mobile app, a unique blockchain identity
            is automatically created for you, as a user of the app. By default,
            this blockchain identity is anonymous, i.e. it cannot be linked to
            the user's personal information.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, by your own discretion, you have the opportunity to link
            your blockchain identity to your real identity, by additionally
            entering your name and other personal data. This is optional feature
            - you may take advantage of it, only if you wish to. The purpose of
            this feature is to increase the credibility of the transactions made
            and to contribute to more reliable legal consequences of the latter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with the data in the preceding paragraphs, upon the
            installation of the ReCheck mobile app, a digital token is received
            from Google Play (resp. - Apple Store) and stored on ReCheck’s
            server. This digital token is used by us for the purposes of
            identification of the user's device when sending push notifications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your personal data, obtained upon the use of ReCheck’s services,
            will be processed for one or more of the following purposes: <br />
            ✓ Provision of the requested services;<br />
            ✓ Backing up and restoring the unique blockchain identity;<br />
            ✓ Provision of support, customer service and software updates;<br />
            ✓ Sending invoices for the services used;<br />
            ✓ Sending essential information of the blockchain network and the
            technical infrastructure for hash and data storage;<br />
            ✓ Informing you about updates and improvements, potential risks and
            problems;<br />
            ✓ Sending directly into the app push notifications regarding the
            services being used (e.g. notifications of received documents,
            pending actions of the user etc.).

            Chapter 3.<br />
            PRIVACY BY DESIGN AND DATA SECURITY
          </p>
          <p>
            In the course of development of our software services, personal data
            security takes place among our highest priorities. Here are some of
            the major advantages of our services in terms of data security:
            <br />
            3.1. Recheck uses decentralized login when users log in with their
            unique blockchain identity, which is being stored on their
            smartphone. In this way, users are the owners of their identity,
            which is anonymous. As explained above, they may or may not link
            this blockchain identity to their real identity.<br />
            3.2. When using our services, exchange of files is completely
            possible without collecting personal data neither of the sender, nor
            of the recipient. Files may be sent directly to the anonymous
            blockchain identity of the recipient. No email, phone, names or
            other personal information of the users to whom information is being
            sent is required.<br />
            3.3. In order to increase data security, we have introduced
            pseudonymization mechanism, by giving a nickname or a “handle” to
            each user.<br />
            3.4. All documents that a user shares through the ReCheck services
            are encrypted with a private key owned and stored only by this user.
            No passwords and usernames are stored on our servers. Without the
            personal key of the respective individual user, the uploaded
            documents cannot be read. <br />
            3.5. Users will have the option to register a hash of one document
            in a blockchain without uploading it to our server - the document
            remains locally on their machine. Hashing is a cryptographic
            technique that we use generates a unique string of characters that
            serves as a digital fingerprint of the respective document. In terms
            of data security, by its nature this is one of the most reliable
            encryption techniques.
